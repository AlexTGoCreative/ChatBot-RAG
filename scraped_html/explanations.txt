0 – No Threats Found Meaning:This result indicates that the file was scanned successfully and no threats were detected. Alternatively, it can also mean the file was empty.User Guidance:You can generally consider the file to be safe, based on the current antivirus engine results. However, note that no antivirus solution can guarantee 100% detection. If you have reasons to doubt the file, a deeper manual inspection may be warranted despite this result.1 – Infected/Known Meaning:The file has been positively identified as containing a known threat. This detection is based on signature or heuristic analysis by one or more scanning engines.User Guidance:Do not open or use this file. It has been confirmed as malicious and may contain viruses, ransomware, trojans, worms, or other forms of malware. Immediate deletion or isolation is recommended. If the file was downloaded from a trusted source, you should notify them immediately.2 – Suspicious Meaning:The file has not been definitively marked as malicious, but it exhibits behavior or characteristics commonly associated with threats. These may include obfuscation, macros, or anomalies in structure.User Guidance: Proceed with caution. While not confirmed as malware, the file could still be dangerous. Consider manual analysis or sandbox execution before trusting the file. If it's from an unverified source, you may want to discard it.3 – Failed To Scan Meaning:The scan attempt failed. This usually happens due to technical issues, such as an unreadable file, invalid format, corrupted data, or lack of read permissions. If no scan engines were enabled, this is the default result.User Guidance:You should assume the file was not evaluated properly. Try scanning it again or verify that the file is accessible and supported. In some cases, the file could be intentionally crafted to resist scanning.5 – Unknown Meaning:This status is used only in bulk hash lookups and means that the file hash was not found in the MetaDefender database. It is not returned for individual file scans.User Guidance:The file’s reputation is undetermined based on the database. If you are unsure about the file origin or purpose, perform a full scan or behavioral analysis.7 – Skipped Clean Meaning:The file scan was intentionally skipped because the file type is part of an "allowlist" (types deemed safe by policy).User Guidance:While the system considers the file type safe by default, be cautious if you suspect file spoofing or tampering. For instance, a seemingly safe .txt file may still contain encoded scripts if misclassified. 8 – Skipped Infected Meaning:The file was not scanned because it belongs to a blocked file type, typically set by administrators. These are considered high risk and are denied by policy.User Guidance:Treat this file as dangerous by default. It’s recommended not to use or distribute it without further investigation or confirmation from the source.9 – Exceeded Archive Depth Meaning:The file is a compressed archive (e.g., .zip, .rar, .7z) with nested layers beyond the allowed scanning depth.User Guidance:Not all inner contents were scanned. This is a common technique used by malware to hide malicious files deep within archives. You should extract and analyze the inner layers manually if possible.10 – Not Scanned / No scan results Meaning:This indicates the scanning engine did not produce any result. It may occur due to engine updates, disabled scan features, or internal logic.User Guidance:Since the file was not evaluated, it should be treated as unknown. Re-scan it later or use an alternative scanner toensure a result is returned.11 – Aborted Meaning:The scan process was interrupted due to an issue with OPSWAT's infrastructure, such as service downtime or processing errors.User Guidance:The result is incomplete and should not be trusted. Try submitting the file again later.12 – Encrypted Meaning:The file is encrypted or password-protected, which prevents the engine from scanning its contents. This includes encrypted ZIP/RAR files or password-locked PDFs and documents.User Guidance:You will need to manually decrypt or extract the file for it to be scanned. Do not trust encrypted files unless you know the sender and the file’s contents.
